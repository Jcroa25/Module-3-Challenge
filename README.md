# Module-3-Challenge

Description- During this assignment I had to create a password generator to using javascript meeting certain criteria like creatiing popups asking for character limits, uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters and numbers. I had to create a function "generate password" button and I added a few small things like a solid border around the card to make it pop more as well as a hover styling to the button.
